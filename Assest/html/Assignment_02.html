    <dl class = "info"><b><h3>The origin of the name of Nashik is linked with the epic of Ramayana. According to this epic, Laxman cut off the nose of Shurpanaka of Ravana’s sister. So this place was called ‘Nasik’. The Government of Maharashtra changed it to Nashik.The Godavari river flowing through the two parts of Nashik and Panchavati flows through the nine hills, ie the flowing from the ‘Nav Shikhan’. The Sanskrit word shikha means hill. This means that ‘Nav Shikha’ has become Nashik from the city. From ancient times, Nashik city and surrounding area were known by different names. There are five such names, such as Janasthan, Trikantak, Gulshanabad, Nasik and Existing Nashik. Historical period has been considered as a religious place of Nashik. It is mentioned that Shriram was staying at ‘Panchavati’ in the Ramayana in Nashik area. Mahakavi Kalidas and Bhavabhuti have expressed their respect for Nashik. During the Mughal empire, Nashik was known as Gulshanabad, the city of Gulab, as ‘Gulshananabad’. There are two opinions about how the city was named “Nashik”. There is such an opinion that “Navishi is a city of nine peaks” and later Deshbas Nashik. And there is another reference to Ramayana. When Ram, his wife Sita and brother Lakshman lived in Panchavati area of Nashik, they cut the nose of Ravana’s sister (‘Nasika’ in the Sanskrit language) at this place in Shurancha. It has also been called Nasik or Nashik. This opinion is more popular.Every 12 years, the Kumbh Mela is filled here. The temples here and the Godavari river are famous. There are warehouses that are excavated around AD Sun 1200. Godavari river is called South Ganges in Nashik.</h3></b></dl>
